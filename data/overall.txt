However , once I received my predictably mediocre order of what Dokebi thinks passes as Korean fair , ( sometimes you have to settle when it 's your only option ) , I got through about half my kimchee before I found a piece of random lettuce accompanied by a far more disgusting , slimy , clearly bad piece of fish skin .####[([38], [52], 'NEG'), ([15, 16], [7], 'NEG')]
My girlfriend , being slightly more aggressive , and having been equally disgusted causing her to throw out the remainder of her barely eaten meal , called back only to be informed that I was probably wrong and that it was most likely an oyster , and that we were also blacklisted from their restaurant .####[([24], [12], 'NEG')]

Best Indian Restaurant in the City####[([1, 2], [0], 'POS')]
This small Astoria souvlaki spot makes what many consider the best gyros in New York .####[([11], [10], 'POS')]
What really makes it shine is the food , which is aggressively seasoned with Cyrpriot spices , and all made in-house ( even the gyro meat and sausages ) , and made of much higher quality ingredients that might otherwise be expected .####[([7], [4], 'POS'), ([24, 25], [20], 'POS'), ([27], [20], 'POS'), ([36], [34, 35], 'POS')]
